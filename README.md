## `Project Overview`
____
In this project, I investigate the Titanic Dataset with the use of the Python libraries Sklearn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn.

### Dataset Information/ Data Dictionary/Variable Notes
____
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

Titanic Data - Contains demographics and passenger information from 891 of the 2224 passengers and crew on board the Titanic

**Pclass**:  A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
1st = Upper
2nd = Middle
3rd = Lower

**Age**: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5

**Sibsp**: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)

**Parch**: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Parent = mother, father
Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.

### Initial Questions & Data Investigation
_____
- Did the Port of Embarkation affect the chances of surviving?.
- Did the Pclass affect the chances of surviving?.
- How did the other factors influence this?
- Did Age effect the chances of surviving?
